Hello World;

This is a personal project from the book Pro Angular 5th Edition, it is a example project to learn the basic of angular, those being:
Module, Component and Templates.
The idea of this Project is to make an Web App that works as a To-Do list, you can add new to-do items, and mark the ones you are done.

More Projects like this are to come.
